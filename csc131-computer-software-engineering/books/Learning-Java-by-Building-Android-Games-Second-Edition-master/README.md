## What is this book about?
Android is one of the most popular mobile operating systems presently. It uses the most popular programming language, Java, as the primary language for building apps of all types. However, this book is unlike other Android books in that it doesn’t assume that you already have Java proficiency.

This book covers the following exciting features: <First 5 What you'll learn points>
* Set up a game development environment in Android Studio

* Implement screen locking, screen rotation, pixel graphics, and play sound effects

* Respond to a player’s touch, and program intelligent enemies who challenge the player in different ways

* Learn game development concepts, such as collision detection, animating sprite sheets, simple tracking and following, AI, parallax       backgrounds, and particle explosions

* Animate objects at 60 frames per second (FPS) and manage multiple independent objects using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
