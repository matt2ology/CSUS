# CSC130 - Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis 
*Prerequisite(s): CSC 20, CSC 28; CSC 28 may be taken concurrently.*

## Term Typically Offered: Fall, Spring

Specification, implementation, and manipulation of complex data structures: linear/lists, stacks, queues, trees, sets, and graphs. Design and analysis of algorithms. Recursion and stack-based memory management. Advanced searching and sorting. NP-completeness.

### Topics Covered
***
* Design, representation and implementation of data structures
* Algorithm analysis and design: Big-O notation; time requirement; space requirement; counting techniques (4 hours). 
* Linear lists and multilists: application of stacks and queues, priority queues
* Trees: binary and n-ary trees; traversals; threaded trees; heaps; binary search trees, AVL trees, B-trees, and general search trees 
* Sets and their representation: bit map, hash table, union-find 
* Graphs: traversals; spanning trees; shortest paths 
* Recursion and stack-based memory management 
* Advanced sorting: heapsort, treesort, radix sort; comparison with other sort algorithms 
* Problem space searching: BFS and DFS 
* NP-completeness
