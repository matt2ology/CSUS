# Exercise07: Skill - Graphical Methods For Comparing Distributions

## Exercise

Pick two statistical distributions with, probability density function's, PDF's that look completely different.
For example, in class we used the uniform distribution and the Chi squared distribution.
Generate data from one distribution, and create two QQ plots for this same data plotted against the quantiles of two different distributions.

Turn in these two QQ plots.
They can be on the same axes, or different.

Use any software you like.
