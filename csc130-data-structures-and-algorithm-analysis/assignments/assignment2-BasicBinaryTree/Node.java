 * <h1>Overview</h1>In recursively defined structures, like trees, all the
 * coding (and complexity) is found in the recursive structure itelf. In thecase
 * of trees,the node will contain the vast amount of the logic andbehavior. You
 * are going to create a very, very basic node clwith a nice, well-documented,
 * ad well-written solutio. We will build upon later, to crate more advance tree
 * structures.
 * 
 * <h2>Interface</h2>Create a very basic node class. All this requires is a left
 * and right link (to another node) and a generic data field. It should also
 * have a few constructors. In particular, you need one that will create a node
 * with links to two other nodes.
